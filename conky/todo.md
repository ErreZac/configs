Update on work progress:
- The definition of the input and output needed for the task is now completed. In particular, the data format and structure have been agreed with OSM (Waqas, Jas, Vassilis); Details are in WPK-168, now completed. Furthermore, preliminary software integration and communication details have been discussed with OSM (Waqas, Jas, Vassilis).
- A draft implementation of the collision detection module has been set up (not reported in the proposal but essential to trigger the whole collision avoidance toolchain).
-Preliminary study on the kinematic constraints has been performed.
-Literature study on the cost functions suitable for marine collision avoidance is in progress.

Targets for the upcoming two weeks:
- Improve the collision detection module;
- Continue the preliminary studies on constraints and cost functions;
- A meeting with the end users will be planned to discuss the definition of the kinematic constraints.

Problems/risks and solutions:
- Currently none.

Others:
- NA

Update on work progress:
- Definition of the optimization problem is in progress. Preliminary studies about the problem formulation (cost and constraints) have been made based on scientific literature and previous meetings with end users. We plan to have a preliminary formulation within 2 weeks (half way through the activity) to discuss it with the end users

Targets for the upcoming two weeks:
- Continue the preliminary studies on constraints and cost functions;
- A meeting with the end users will be planned to discuss the definition of the kinematic constraints.
